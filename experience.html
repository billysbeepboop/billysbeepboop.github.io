                <p>B2B lab automation tech - I joined the team just as they had wrapped up design of the second generation of their cell factory 
                    platform, taking on a highly diverse role that saw me come to figure out all sorts of challenges scaling up production, 
                    getting units in the field, and driving continuous improvement. There were some very exciting new technology spaces I had 
                    to master. It was only my abrupt need to relocate back to SF with my partner that had me depart so soon. The company was 
                    actually formed in YC and had a strong "Bay Area atmosphere"</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Hardware lead for scaled-deployment & DVT of iDEM Single flagship automated cell manufacturing platform - drove progress 
                    from early production builds through first international installations & field support</li>
                  <li>Co-led extensive firefighting efforts involving RCA, triage, and total-resolution of diverse electromechanical failures; 
                    outcomes spanning patches, formal redesigns, QI SOPs, novel tooling, and better response practices</li>
                  <li>Designed & executed new processes for rapid scaling: SOP dev, pre-compliance/spec validation, reliability testing, DFM revs, 
                    installation/logistical procedures; compressed commissioning timelines by >60%</li>
                  <li>Shipped novel HW features from blank sheet: vapor-H2O2 decontamination, HW UX upgrades, flat-pack structures for system stacking, 
                    anti-fungal material changes - many more fully conceptualised for later rollout</li>
                  <li>Ideated and completed numerous SPIKES investigating potential systemic issues, new features, and hardware upgrades</li>
                  <li>Key player in selecting, then porting over to new CAD platform (Solidworks to Onshape)</li>

                <p>Consumer robotics - This role was initially prototyping/R&D oriented, with a mandate to create something original in form 
                    and function. With increasing design progress, it became more about EVT and DFM. We were producing most parts on hard 
                    tooling and shipping the first few production units by my departure.</p>
                <ul>

                  <li>Created MCU/DAQ instrumentation & analytics tools (MATLAB/xls) to build statistical/physics models driving
                    cleaning efficacy, noise reduction, reliability, & OTS part selection. Many leveraged across hardware team</li>
                  <li>Wrote & deployed Python/Rust scripts to collect sensor data, then implement complex robot behavioural
                    features for live diagnostics & situation avoidance, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230062104A1/en?oq=20230062104" target="_blank">some patented market firsts</a></li>

                  <p>EVs, production/motorsports - In this highly formative role, I got exposure to the high-precision, small-scale engineering of 
                    Formula E and the colossal challenges of bringing an entire EV sedan into production for the very first time.</p>
                  <ul>

                    <li>Overhauled initial tendered design with material efficiency improvements & reshaping of core layout, resulting
                        in 17% weight loss, 61% higher power density, lower part count & simpler serviceability
                        Proactively sought out & collaborated with CMs, Tier 1s, & prototype vendors to validate DfM, continuously
                        manage quality & handle deviations for tens of parts with volumes from 00's to 0000's</li>

                  <h3>College-era experiences @Georgia Tech and elsewhere - 2016-2020</h3>
                  <p>College (obviously) taught me a lot, but these extras helped me to put it all into practice at the same time, 
                    while exposing me to the pragmatic realities of engineering in the wild</p>

                    <p>I was all-in on the BAJA SAE racing team, where we'd design, build, and compete an off-road racing car 
                        from scratch every year. It was a hugely formative and memorable period. I ended up holding various lead 
                        positions and building out a whole new DAQ sub-team. The year I was Chief Engineer, 
                        we up-ranked from 77th to 7th place at national competition!</p>

                    <p>I interned with the top-level technical specialists in the field service engineering division of 
                        Cummins Heavy Engines in Columbus, IN. The work was modeling and performance analytics oriented, with
                        excursions into the field all over the country.</p>

                        cohort meant I got to participate in a whole lot of special curricular activities. I studied abroad in China, then again 
                        across Oceania, went to conferences, retreats, and even helped to host the SSNC19 convention. I owe this incredible
