      <h1>You can call me Billy</h1>
      <p>I am a hardware engineer and serial tinkerer 
        with years of experience all over the product development cycle and countless technological contexts. 
        My fascination with designing and implementing physical artefacts has always run deep, taking me all over 
        the world in the process - take a look around and see for yourself.

                I have used this special transitional moment to knuckle down on all kinds of projects

                for going all-in on the next opportunity, which I want to be a major commitment.
