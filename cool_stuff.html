            <p>To relax from building things full-time … I build other things, part-time. Just for fun, always 
                from scratch, and mostly solo - these are a few examples made in my home workshop, college shops, or Humanmade in SF:</p>

                <h3>Bean-to-bar small batch chocolate maker - 2025</h3>
                <p>This one is a WIP right now, but it already does exactly what you think. I spent a great deal of time 
                    thinking about how to combine the challenges of grinding, conching, and tempering into a single, fairly 
                    simple architecture that can replace multiple devices and finicky processes, all at a scale suitable for 
                    a chocolate-obsessed individual like me. So much to say about this one - definitely ask me more!</p>

                <h3>Media console/sound system - 2025</h3>
                <p>American Cherry with Rooibos (my favourite tea) stained panels. This console hides a full sound system within 
                    and uses a joining system that neatly hides where the actual connections exist. The hand-carved “fingerprint” 
                    texture on top contrasts the other machine-created forms.</p>

                  <h3>“Jelly Lamp” - 2025</h3>
                  <p>A tensegrity structure using the power cord itself gives the shades of these lamps a slightly wobble when touched, 
                    which is not what the machined Richlite construction suggests will happen. I liked it so much I ended up making 
                    three of them.</p>

                  <p>Birch ply and old rope. I designed this robust piece to neatly fill a standard sheet of plywood and be 
                    100% machinable on a CNC router.</p>

                  <h3>Magnet-reaction Anglepoise lamp - 2023</h3>
                  <p>Fiddling with some magnets one day, I realised they could be configured to create specific shear and friction 
                    force profiles when slid apart, which is exactly what makes an Anglepoise style arm work. I built 2D magnetic 
                    field simulations MATLAB to find the perfect parameters and packaged everything into an (almost) impossibly 
                    slender machined Richlite structure where no springs are used at all.</p>

                  <p>Borrowing just the boiler-grouphead of a Saeco machine, I built a new enclosure and ditched all the analog 
                    electronics for a custom made 1200W digital controller and touchscreen UI. This machine has made well over 
                    1000 shots.</p>

                    and automations to make any drink from 8 different inputs. I wrote a little bluetooth enabled android UI app, 
                    and it can even flush itself clean.</p>

                    for time consumption. I held positions from manufacturing lead, to DAQ lead, to chief engineer.</p>

                    arduino controlled (from a safe distance), and fired successfully a number of times, these were the loudest fun I've had.</p>
